Welcome to Landmark's JDK fork
==============================
The branch *hg* is copied from the official openjdk mercurial repo [jdk-updates/jdk11u](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk-updates/jdk11u).
The branch *dsg* is a forked version with Landmark fixes.

If you want to update jdk to a newer version:

* checkout branch *hg* of this repo
* in a separated folder clone the openjdk hg repo and checkout a required tag.
* copy all files from the hg repo (except .hg and .hgignore) and paste to the git repo folder, choose yes to overwrite files.
* commit changes to git (branch *hg*)
* add a version tag
* push commit to origin/hg
* merge changed from *hg* to *dsg*, resolve conflicts, test and push to *dsg* branch

If you want to make further changes in the fork:

* checkout branch *dsg* of this repo
* create a fix branch from *dsg* branch
* make changes, test, commit and push
* create a pull request to merge your fix branch to *dsg*
